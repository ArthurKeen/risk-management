# Sentries: Risk Management Knowledge Graph

Sentries is an advanced graph intelligence platform that leverages the OFAC SDN dataset to identify and propagate transitive risk through complex ownership, leadership, and familial networks.

## Features
- **RDF-to-Property Graph**: Automatic schema mapping from OWL ontology to ArangoDB collections.
- **Dynamic Risk Vetting**: AQL path-based engine that calculates real-time threat exposure based on transitive relationships.
- **Visual Intelligence**: Custom ArangoDB Visualizer themes for structural exploration and risk heatmaps.
- **Expert Analytics**: Built-in library of saved queries for threat discovery and portfolio risk concentration.

## Architecture
1. **Ontology Layer**: Formal OWL definition of the risk domain.
2. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Memory-efficient XML parsing and batch loading API.
3. **Analytic Engine**: Native AQL traversals for high-fidelity risk calculation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- python 3.8+
- ArangoDB 3.10+ (with Visualizer enabled)

### 2. Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArthurKeen/risk-management.git
cd risk-management
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration
Copy `template.env` to `.env` and provide your ArangoDB credentials:
```bash
cp template.env .env
# Edit .env with your endpoint and password
```

### 4. Run Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Flatten the OFAC XML
python3 scripts/flatten_ofac.py

# 2. Load ontology and data
python3 scripts/load_data.py

# 3. Install themes and dashboard
python3 scripts/install_theme.py
python3 scripts/install_dashboard.py

# 4. Calculate direct risk
python3 scripts/calculate_direct_risk.py
```

## Usage
Open the ArangoDB UI and navigate to **Graphs** -> **KnowledgeGraph**. Select the **sentries_risk_heatmap** theme to visualize threats. Use the **Saved Queries** tab to run the dynamic vetting tools.
